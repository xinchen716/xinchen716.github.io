            <h1>Mirror</h1>
            <p>"Mirror" is an immersive audio-visual interactive installation that centres around the concept of the mirror as a metaphor for self-perception and identity. At its core, the work invites viewers to question whether our identities in the digital era are authentic representations of who we truly are or merely virtual constructs shaped by data, algorithms, and the digital environment. Throughout history, mirrors have been potent symbols of self-reflection, serving as tools for individuals to examine and understand themselves.  </p>
            
            <p>However, as technology evolves, it continues to provide new types of 'mirrors'â€”digital interfaces that reflect and shape our sense of self in increasingly complex ways."Mirror" explores this dynamic, challenging participants to consider how technology has not only expanded the boundaries of our imagination about who we are but also fundamentally altered the ways we perceive ourselves and engage with the external world.
